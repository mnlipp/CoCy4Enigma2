CoCyDreambox
============

Since I had my Dreambox, I have been looking for a UPnP renderer.
End of 2012 an implementation seemed to appear, but it wouldn't
run on my DM7025 -- probably too old.

So I finished my own implementation of a UPnP renderer after all.
You should be able to install it by downloading the latest version
from the SF "Files" section, copy it to your Dreambox and run
"opkg install <absolut file name>".

I have tried to list all dependencies in the package, so they
should install automatically. As, however, I have been experimenting
quite some time, my box is no longer "clean". If you exerience any
problems, please report them using "Tickets" on the SF page.
