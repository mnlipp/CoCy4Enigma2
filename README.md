Since I had my Dreambox, I have been looking for a UPnP renderer.
End of 2012 an implementation seemed to appear, but it wouldn't
run on my DM7025 -- probably too old.

So I finished my own implementation of a UPnP renderer after all
and the initial release did work on the DM7025.

Sorry to say, however, for all owners of a DM7025, I have moved 
to a VU Ultimo with OpenPLI by now and I will not maintain 
backward compatibility.

You should be able to install the renderer by downloading the 
latest version from the SF "Files" section, copy it to your 
Dreambox and run "opkg install <absolut file name>".

I have tried to list all dependencies in the package, so they
should install automatically. As, however, I have been experimenting
quite some time, my box is no longer "clean". If you experience any
problems, please report them using "Tickets" on the SF page.
