============

Since I had my Dreambox, I have been looking for a UPnP renderer.
End of 2012 an implementation seemed to appear, but it wouldn't
run on my DM7025 -- probably too old.

So I finished my own implementation of a UPnP renderer after all
and the initial release did work on the DM7025.

Sorry to say, however, for all owners of a DM7025, I have moved 
to a VU Ultimo with OpenPLI by now and I will not maintain 
backward compatibility.

You should be able to install the renderer by downloading the 
latest version from the 
[releases](https://github.com/mnlipp/CoCy4Enigma2/releases) page, 
copy it to your Dreambox and run "opkg install <absolut file name>".

I have tried to list all dependencies in the package, so they
should install automatically. As, however, I have been experimenting
quite some time, my box is no longer "clean". If you experience any
problems, please report them by creating an
[issue](https://github.com/mnlipp/CoCy4Enigma2/issues).
